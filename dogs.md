# Dogs

Dogs and Musgroves go way back. Everyone in the family loves dogs, and everyone has had them. My grandfather SK would bring them back for hunting all the time, and inevitably "ruin them" and turn them into pets. I've had lots, and consider dogs something I know a lot about. They aren't complicated, but people still have trouble figuring them out because they want to anthropomorphize them. And it's one of those things you can't tell people and ever have them believe you, like telling someone they have no style or fashion sense. Everyone thinks they do.
