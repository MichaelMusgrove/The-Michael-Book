# Cecelia

Cecelia, of course, is my daughter who I'm throwing this together for, and my mother, for whom she was named. Her mother and stepsister insist on calling her "Celia," pronouncing it "cilia" as in paramecium legs. My daughter is Paramecium Legs Musgrove.

Cecelia was a life-changer, which was desired and anticipated. I had high expectations for her, given she was healthy, and she's surpassed them all. In a good way. She's a special child, and it's evident in her personality, temperament, curiosity factor, sense of humor, alertness, observation, strength, creativity, and a million other ways. She's a remarkable little person and I'm humbled to call her my daughter. I know plenty of fathers say that, but it really is objectively true in her case. She's exceptional.
