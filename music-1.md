#Music - 1

Note: this isn't a comprehensive list, by a million miles. There was a time when I was going to see live bands in Charleston at the Music Farm, Myskyns and Cumberlands mostly, at least several times a week for years, not to mention all the festivals and events with live music friends of mine like the Blue Dogs played at. But the big-name bands I saw in DC, Columbia, Atlanta, St. Petersburg, and a bunch of other random, larger cities.

1. The Allman Brothers
2. The Who
3. The Grateful Dead
4. The Ramones
5. Crosby Stills & Nash
6. Neil Young
7. Sting
8. Paul McCartney
9. Kid Rock \(shudder\) I sat next to him before the performance and didn't know who he was. I thought it was some drunk redneck. Which it was.
10. Dave Matthews
11. Little Feat
